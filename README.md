# Barcode Detection Using Deep Learning and Pyzbar
 Deep Learning Barcode

Steps to run the notebook.ipynb:

1. Go to your google drive. Under "My Drive" , create a folder named "DeepLearningProjectNYU".
2. Copy the "Barcode-detection-main" folder of this github repo to your google drive ""DeepLearningProjectNYU". So the folder path in your google drive looks like this:
   My Drive-->DeepLearningProjectNYU----->Barcode-detection-main
3. Run the cells of notebook.ipynb in Barcode-detection-main.

## Understanding the aim of the project: 

The project is explained in the notebook.ipynb in this repo. 


## Creedits and References:

A lot of the code for the project was cited from https://github.com/dchakour/Barcode-detection.
However this code was modified to fulfill the different aim of the project. Additionally, extra datasets were created for grayscale images and 
the notebook.ipynb is entirely different. Some code changes were also made to satisfy the different installment module versions as can be seen from requirements.txt
